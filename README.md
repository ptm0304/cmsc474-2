This project was done for cmsc474.
This is a Java program that plays a game on a board composed of hexagonal tiles. There are two players: Green and Red.
Each player has four markers. You must move exactly one move on your turn. The objective is to get your four markers into
a straight line. Alpha-Beta pruning, node ordering, iterative deepening techniques are used.
